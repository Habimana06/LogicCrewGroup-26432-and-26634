PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project explores SQL Window Functions through practical examples. Window functions allow for complex analytical queries that would otherwise require multiple self-joins or subqueries. These functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row and managing our products, providing powerful analytical capabilities.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project explores SQL Window Functions through practical examples. Window functions allow for complex analytical queries that would otherwise require multiple self-joins or subqueries. These functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row and managing our products, providing powerful analytical capabilities.
# DATA SET STRUCTURE
Below is the SQL script used to create our employees table and populate it with sample data:
-- Create Products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
